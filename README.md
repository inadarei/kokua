Kokua is an implementation of the [Representor](https://github.com/the-hypermedia-project/charter#representor-pattern) pattern, written
in modern Javascript/Node. It allows developers to represent hypermedia messages
in a flexible media type, purpose-designed for the task: [Hyper](http://hyperjson.io)
and automatically outputs messages in a variety of popular Hypermedia formats
such as:

1. HAL
2. Siren
3. Collection+JSON
